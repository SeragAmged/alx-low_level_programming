# Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming

This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and
algorithm track at the alx-SoftwareEngineering program facilitated by Holberton School. I am learning about data
structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while
working in the C language. I update this repo with my learning progresses with hands-on projects as listed below:

* [0x00. C - Hello, World](./0x00-hello_world)
* [0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while)



- more projects are coming soon!!
- I am on my way to be the best software engineer that I  can possibly  be!!
